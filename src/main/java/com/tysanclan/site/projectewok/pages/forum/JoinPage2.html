			To join Tysan, you need to write a short motivation about why
			you wish to join. This motivation should be at least 75 words. 
			If you are unsure what to put here, tell us something about the following:
			<ul>
				<li>What games do you play, and what you enjoy about them?</li>
				<li>What kind of person are you?</li>
				<li>How long have you been playing online?</li>
				<li>What are you looking for in a clan?</li>

			In addition, we would like to know what your primary game is. This will make it easier
			for us to find a suitable mentor. <br />
