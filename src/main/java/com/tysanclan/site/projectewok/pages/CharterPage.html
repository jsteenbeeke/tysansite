</head>
<body>
<wicket:extend>
    This charter describes the organisation known as the Tysan Clan, it's
    procedures, the roles, privileges and duties of it's members for as
    long as they choose to keep using this website.

    <h2>1. Membership</h2>
    <a id="1"></a>
    The Tysan Clan is a private organisation and reserves the right to grant or
    deny membership to any person.
    <h3>1.2. Becoming a member</h3>
    <a id="12"></a>
    Membership may be requested by any person, unless said person is:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="121"></a>Under 13 years of age. Further age
            restrictions may be imposed by regulations
        </li>
        <li><a id="122"></a>A member of another online gaming
            organisation involved in the same games as the Tysan Clan.
            Exceptions may be granted by regulations on a group basis, or by the
            Chancellor on an individual basis
        </li>
        <li><a id="123"></a>A former member whose membership was
            terminated following a Truthsayer trial
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>1.3. Trial period</h3>
    <a id="13"></a>
    A membership request does not guarantee membership. Following a membership
    application, a member needs approval from at least one Senator before being
    granted a trial membership (in case no Senators are available to vote, a
    trial membership is granted by default after 3 days).
    A trial membership lasts at most 17 days, and will automatically convert
    into a normal membership unless the trial member:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="131"></a>Does not login for a period of 7 days or
            longer
        </li>
        <li><a id="132"></a>Receives a percentage of positive approval
            votes (by all non-trial members) of less than 60%
        </li>
        <li><a id="133"></a>Is convicted by a Truthsayer</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1.4. Termination</h3>
    <a id="14"></a>
    Furthermore, a membership may be terminated in the following situations:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="141"></a>A member is not marked as being
            &quot;retired&quot; or &quot;on vacation&quot;, and has not logged
            in for at least 14 days
        </li>
        <li><a id="142"></a>A member is marked as being &quot;on
            vacation&quot;, but not as &quot;retired&quot;, and has not logged
            in for at least 60 days
        </li>
        <li><a id="143"></a>A member is marked as being
            &quot;retired&quot;, and has not logged in for at least 1 year
        </li>
        <li><a id="144"></a>A member has been found in violation of a
            regulation and been judged guilty by a Truthsayer, with either the
            member having comitted a severe infraction, or multiple minor ones.
            Such a violation also permanently revokes any right of membership.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Regulations</h2>

        </li>
        <li><a id="212"></a>Drafted by the Chancellor and approved by a

    <h2>3. Ranks</h2>
    <a id="3"></a>
    Each member of the Tysan Clan is given a rank, representing either seniority
    or a specific function. These ranks are Chancellor, Senator, Truthsayer,
    Revered Member, Senior Member, Full Member, Junior Member and Trial Member.
    Each rank represents either a certain length of membership, or an elected
    position. No rank grants a member the right to give commands to other
    members, unless as specified in this charter or as in regulations, subject
    to
    the restrictions given in <a href="#23">section 2.3</a>.

    <h3>3.1. Chancellor</h3>
    <a id="31"></a>
    The Chancellor is the executive branch of the Tysan Clan, and is therefore

            (counting abstentions as &quot;against&quot; votes)
        </li>
        <li><a id="3117"></a>The Chancellor has the right to propose

            creation of groups (see also <a href="#4">article 4</a>)

    </ol>

    <h4>3.1.2. Election</h4>
    <a id="312"></a>
    To become a Chancellor, a member must first be nominated. A nomination can
    be secured if your rank is at least Full Member, and either you have donated
    at least $30 in the previous 6 months,
    or at least 5% of the total number of members endorses you. Endorsements can
    not be given by Trial Members. All nominated members participate in an
    election by Borda Count, which
    lasts 1 week. Each member, with the exception of Trial Members, assigns a
    unique score to
    each candidate (with the highest score being the number of candidates, and
    the lowest being 1). The member with the highest total score becomes the new
    Chancellor.
    Chancellor elections take place every 6 months.

    <ol>
        <li><a id="3131"></a>The election of another member as
            Chancellor
        </li>
        <li><a id="3132"></a>An impeachment procedure, which can only be
            initiated by a Truthsayer and requires a two-third Senate majority
        </li>
        <li><a id="3133"></a>By voluntarily stepping down</li>
    </ol>
    A former Chancellor is however free to participate in elections, and can
    therefore be re-elected after being impeached.

    <h3>3.2. Senator</h3>
    <a id="32"></a>
    The Senate is the legislative branch of the Tysan Clan, as well as a
    moderator for both the Chancellor and for Truthsayers. A member of the
    Senate is
    called a senator.
    <h4>3.2.1. Privileges and responsibilities</h4>
    <a id="321"></a>
    A Senator has the following privileges and responsibilities:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="3211"></a>A Senator has the right to draft
            regulations and present them before the rest of the Senate
        </li>
        <li><a id="3212"></a>A Senator has the right to vote on drafted
            regulations
        </li>
        <li><a id="3213"></a>A Senator has the right to overrule a veto
            by the Chancellor, if two-thirds of the Senate agree
        </li>
        <li><a id="3214"></a>A Senator has the right to approve
            Truthsayers proposed by the Chancellor, for which a two-third
            majority is required
        </li>
        <li><a id="3215"></a>A Senator has the right to approve
            inter-clan alliances
        </li>
        <li><a id="3216"></a>A Senator has the right to approve new
            achievements
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>3.2.2. Election</h4>
    <a id="322"></a>
    To become a Senator, a member must first be nominated. A nomination can be
    secured if your rank is at least Full Member, and either you have donated at
    least $20 in the previous 6 months,
    or at least 3% of the total number of members endorses you. Endorsements can
    not be given by Trial Members. Each member, with the exception of Trial
    Members, assigns a unique score to
    each candidate (with the highest score being the number of candidates, and
    the lowest being 1). The top N members with the highest total scores gain a
    seat in the Senate, where N is at
    least 2 of the total number of members (based on actual number of members,
    the formula is
    <pre
            style="display: inline;">max ( 2, min ( candidates-1, (membercount / 20) + 1 ))</pre>
    ).
    Senate elections take place every 6 months.

    <h4>3.2.3. End of term</h4>
    <a id="323"></a>
    A Senator loses his position in the following cases:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="3231"></a>Not participating in a Senate election, or
            not ending in the top N
        </li>
        <li><a id="3232"></a>Being convicted of a regulation violation</li>
        <li><a id="3233"></a>If the total Senate size drops to less than
            40% of it's original size, in which case new elections are held
        </li>
        <li><a id="3234"></a>By voluntarily stepping down</li>
    </ol>
    Note that convictions do not bar a member from participating in elections -
    so a convicted member can become Senator again.

    <h3>3.3. Truthsayer</h3>
    <a id="33"></a>
    The Truthsayers form the judicial branch of the Tysan Clan, and act as
    moderators and judges both online and on our website.

    <h4>3.3.1. Privileges and responsibilities</h4>
    <a id="331"></a>
    A Truthsayer has the following rights and responsibilities.

        <li><a id="3312"></a>A Truthsayer has the right to declare a
            regulation &quot;untenable&quot;, after which a clan majority can
            decide to repeal the act
        </li>
        <li><a id="3313"></a>A Truthsayer has the right to convict other
            members of regulation violations. Note however that a Truthsayer can
            not convict a member if he himself pressed the charges, but another
            Truthsayer can
        </li>
        <li><a id="3314"></a>A Truthsayer has the right to moderate any
            public forum
        </li>
        <li><a id="3315"></a>A Truthsayer has the duty to uphold the
            legit nature of the Tysan Clan as vigorously as possible
        </li>
        <li><a id="3316"></a>A Truthsayer has the right to approve
            achievement requests of members
        </li>
        <li><a id="3317"></a>A Truthsayer may block a new achievement if
            it uses imagery that violates regulations, upon which the submitter

        <li><a id="3318"></a>A Truthsayer may remove a new achievement
            if it violates or promotes the violation of this charter or one or
            more Regulations
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>3.3.2. Becoming a Truthsayer</h4>
    <a id="332"></a>
    To become a Truthsayer, a member must have at least the rank of Full Member
    and not currently serve as Chancellor or Senator (or participate in
    an election for such a position). The Chancellor can then nominate said
    member for the position of Truthsayer (which the member can accept or deny),
    after which a two-third majority of the Senate must approve the nomination.
    If this is approved, the member becomes a Truthsayer.

    <h4>3.3.3. End of term</h4>
    <a id="333"></a>
    The Truthsayer position is in principle indefinite, but can be ended in
    several ways:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="3331"></a>By being convicted of a regulation
            violation. Regardless of the violation, this will result in
            terminated membership as Truthsayers should know better
        </li>
        <li><a id="3332"></a>By being elected as either Senator or
            Chancellor
        </li>
        <li><a id="3333"></a>By voluntarily stepping down</li>
        <li><a id="3334"></a>By a 66% majority vote (with abstentions
            counting as no) by the Senate. This vote can only be initiated after
            a formal complaint has been filed by a member and approved by the
            Chancellor, provided the Chancellor has taken effort to resolve the
            conflict as a mediator between the member who filed the complaint
            and the Truthsayer in question.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3.4. Trial Members</h3>
    <a id="34"></a>
    A Trial Member is a member who has been accepted by the Senate, but has not
    yet been accepted by the clan as a whole.
    <h4>3.4.1. Limitations</h4>
    <a id="341"></a>
    A Trial Member has no special responsibilities or limitations, except the
    following:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="3411"></a>A Trial Member's membership is terminated
            if he or she has not logged in for at least 7 days
        </li>
        <li><a id="3412"></a>A Trial Member may not vote</li>
        <li><a id="3413"></a>A Trial Member may not gain
            &quot;vacation&quot; or &quot;retired&quot; status
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>3.4.2. Becoming a Trial Member</h4>
    <a id="342"></a>
    A person can become a Trial Member by the procedure described in <a
        href="#12">article 1.2</a>.
    <h4>3.4.3. Promotion</h4>
    <a id="343"></a>
    A person gains the rank of Junior Member if meeting the requirements stated
    in article <a
        href="#13">1.3</a>.

    <h3>3.5. Other Members</h3>
    <a id="35"></a>
    The four remaining ranks are Junior Member, Full Member, Senior Member and
    Revered Member. These ranks are granted automatically
    after a given amount of time, and grant no special privileges and have no
    limitations, with the exception of Full Member being the minimum
    rank for becoming Chancellor, Senator or Truthsayer, as described in
    articles <a
        href="#312">3.1.2</a>, <a href="#322">3.2.2</a> and <a
        href="#332">3.3.2</a>.

    These ranks are granted as follows:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="351"></a>The rank of Junior Member is granted upon
            passing the trial vote
        </li>
        <li><a id="352"></a>The rank of Full Member is granted after 4

            5 years of membership
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Groups</h2>
    <a id="4"></a>
    Members of the Tysan Clan have the right to form groups. There are 3 types
    of groups:
    gaming groups, social groups and committees. A gaming group is a group
    dedicated
    to playing a certain game. A social group is a group of people sharing a
    common
    interest, and a committee is a special group created by the Chancellor for
    a specific clan purpose.

    <h3>4.1. Formation</h3>
    <a id="41"></a>
    Any member with the rank Full Member or higher can request the creation of a
    gaming
    group or social group, which must be <a href="#3119">approved by
    the Chancellor</a>. In
    addition, the <a href="#3111">Chancellor can create committees</a>.

    <h3>4.2. Leadership</h3>
    <a id="42"></a>
    The founder of a gaming or social group becomes it's leader and remains so
    until he steps down, at which
    point a <a href="#322">Borda Count vote</a> is held among all group members
    to decide the new leader. In
    case of a committee, the Chancellor can assign a member as it's leader.

    <a id="5"></a>
    A position is a special role a member can have, similar to a committee, but
    covering a responsibility that does not require multiple persons. A position
    is in most cases created and assigned by the Chancellor, and can
    only be revoked by the Chancellor. There are a number of exceptions,
    however.

    <h3>5.1 Treasurer</h3>
    <a id="51"></a>

    The Treasurer is a special position that is held by the person in charge of
    clan finances. The Treasurer is bound by the charter and regulations like

            not enough funds to cover even the most basic essential service
