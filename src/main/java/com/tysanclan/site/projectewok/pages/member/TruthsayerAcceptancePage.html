    <p>You have been nominated to become a Truthsayer by the
        Chancellor. Becoming a Truthsayer is a great responsibility, as it
        grants you the power to punish members, correct the laws of Tysan, and
        start an impeachment procedure against the Chancellor. As part of this
        responsibility you are expected to show exemplary behavior - and even
        a minor infraction of the rules of Tysan may result in the termination
        of your membership.</p>
    <p>If you choose to accept this nomination, the Senate will vote on
        your nomination, and the result of this vote will determine if you
        become a Truthsayer. You are free to decline this nomination, and a
        Truthsayer is free to give up his position once accepted.</p>
    <p>
        Do you accept your nomination as Truthsayer?<br/>
        <br/> <a wicket:id="yes"><img wicket:id="icon"/> Yes, I
        understand the responsibilities, and accept the nomination</a><br/> <a
            wicket:id="no"><img wicket:id="icon"/> No, I'd rather not
        become a Truthsayer</a>
