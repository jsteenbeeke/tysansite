				A Truthsayer can theoretically retain his position indefinitely, unless convincted of a rules violation. If
				however the Truthsayer has not broken any Regulations, they can still be stripped of their position if they
				have used their position irresponsibly.

			<p>
				If you feel a Truthsayer has wronged you in some way, you can file a complaint. The Chancellor will
				then try to mediate between you and the offending Truthsayer. Should this mediation prove to be fruitless,
				the Senate will then decide if the Truthsayer may retain his position.
