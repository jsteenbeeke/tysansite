    	<p>
	        The Tysan Clan is an online gaming clan, originally based on the USEast realm of Battle.net, that focuses
	        on friendship before gaming prowess. It is our belief that gaming should be a means of relaxation, not a
	        second job or an obligation. Our clan was shaped to strengthen these principles.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Many clans on Battle.net are organized in a similar way. A single leader stands at the top, and dozens
        	of ranks separate him from other members of the clan, whose only hope of ever gaining a role of significance
        	is by spending years working their way up, or starting their own clan.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The Tysan Clan rejects these methods of clan organization. In the Tysan Clan, any member can
        	gain a role of significance, and no leader can attain a position without being elected to it.
        	We believe that all members should play a part in the decision process.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Members of the Tysan Clan are never subject to the whims of a single person. No member can be punished
        	or expelled	without due process, and no position of power is ever achieved without the approval of multiple
        	members of the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Due to our unique philosophy, and our adherence to our Clan's traditions, we have been around for a long
        	time. The Tysan Clan was allegedly founded in 1997 by (TYC)Blayde, though no members from that time remain,
        	and the earliest evidence of Tysan's existence dates from 1999 (a recruiting post by (TYC)Judicator on Clan Hall,
        	which we found in the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>).

        <h2>Clan Structure</h2>
        <p>
			Unlike many other clans, the Tysan Clan has a proper separation of powers. The Chancellor has
			<b>executive power</b>, and has the power to appoint persons to various roles, create committees, and veto proposed regulations.
			In addition, the Chancellor can nominate Truthsayers. The Senate has <b>legislative power</b> and has the primary responsibility
			of creating, modifying and repealing regulations. The Senate's secondary responsibilities are to advise the Chancellor,
			to approve Truthsayer nominations and to carry out impeachment procedures should they prove necessary. Finally,
			the Truthsayers have <b>judiciary power</b> in Tysan. Truthsayers are in charge of maintaining order, and have
			the power to judge rules violations as well as declare Regulations untenable . Finally, a Truthsayer can
			start an impeachment procedure.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Ranks</h2>
        <p>
	        The Tysan Clan is characterized by it's flat structure. Many gaming clans, especially on Battle.net, tend
	        to have a large vertical structure with a lot of ranks. These clans attract people who like to boss others
	        around, and are often run by narcissistic adolescents. While the Tysan Clan does have a ranking structure,
	        we only have 8 ranks, 5 of which are solely based on the amount of time spent as a member, and 3 of which
	        represent elected positions within the Clan.
	        
	        <table>
	        	<tr>
	        		<th>Rank</th>
	        		<th>Description</th>
	        	</tr>
	        	<tr wicket:id="ranks">
	        		<td><span wicket:id="icon"></span> <span wicket:id="name"></span></td>
	        		<td><span wicket:id="description"></span></td>

        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>
        The Tysan Clan website was created using the <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java programming language</a>,
        and uses a number of different technologies and frameworks. Our website is primarily based on the 
        <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/">Apache Wicket web application framework</a>
        in combination with the <a href="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring framework</a>
        for Dependency Injection and Transaction processing. Finally, it uses the
        <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate framework</a> for object-relational mapping
        and for connecting with our <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL database</a>.
        In addition to these, it uses a dozen smaller frameworks that tie into these, such as <a href="http://www.fortuityframework.com">Fortuity</a>,
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wiquery/">WiQuery</a> for integration between Wicket,
        Wicket extensions for the <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com">TinyMCE rich text editor</a>,
        and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">JQuery UI</a>
        and <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/397.html">Hibernate Annotations</a>.
