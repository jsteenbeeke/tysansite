            Any member who has been with the clan for two years or longer has
            the
            option to become a retired member, under a number of conditions:
            <ul>
                <li>The member in question holds the rank of Senior Member or
                    Revered Member (and therefore, holds no position as
                    Chancellor,
                    Senator or Truthsayer)
                </li>
                <li>The member in question is not the leader of any gaming
                    group
                </li>
            </ul>
            Becoming a retired member has the following consequences:
            <ul>
                <li>A retired member may not create gaming groups, nor lead
                    them - though he is free to join them
                </li>
                <li>A retired member can not be elected as Chancellor or
                    Senator (nor can he receive nominations for these
                    positions), nor
                    be appointed as Truthsayer
                </li>
                <li>A retired member will not have his membership terminated,
                    unless he does not log in for a full year
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>When going away for an extended period of time (more than 14
                days), it is recommended to activate Vacation Mode. Normally,
                your
                membership is terminated if you do not log in once every 14
                days.
                When vacation mode is active, this period is extended to 60
                days,
                but only if you do not log in during your vacation!</p>

            <p wicket:id="trialwarning">Since you are currently in your trial
                period, please consider the following: why did you join Tysan if
                you
                knew you wouldn't be around during your trial period. Having
                Vacation mode active during your trial period will negatively

                To activate vacation mode, press the Activate button below. <b>BEWARE!
