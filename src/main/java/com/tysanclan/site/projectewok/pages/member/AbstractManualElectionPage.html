				You are using an obsolete browser. Had you been using a proper browser you would not have to use this page, and
				could have used a simple drag and drop procedure to cast your vote. We therefore suggest you download either of
				the following browsers <b>for free</b> and try to cast your vote again. If you must insist on using inferior technology,
				then you can use this page to cast your vote.

				To cast your vote, select your preferred candidates. You should first select the person that has your greatest preference,
				and save the person with the least preference for last.
