		Are you looking for a clan to join? We are always interested in meeting new people to become a part of our clan. <a wicket:id="about">The
		Tysan Clan</a> is a friendly group of gamers who value maturity and friendship above all other things, including gaming
		prowess.
		
		<h2>Why should I join?</h2>
		The Tysan Clan has been around for over a decade and has proven itself to be a resilient clan well
		able to withstand the test of time. Throughout our lifetime we have managed to maintain a high standard
		of legit gameplay, mature members, and fun people to hang out with.
		
		<h2>What kind of people are you looking for?</h2>
		We are looking for people who like playing online games, and strive to become better at them. We only accept
		those who have demonstrated themselves to be mature persons with a friendly attitude and a slight amount of
		insanity.
		
		<h2>So how do I join?</h2>
		First you need a forum account. If you do not have one yet, you should <a wicket:id="register">register</a> one
		right away! Once this is done, all you need to do is log in and hit the "Join Tysan" button, where you will be 
		presented with further instructions. Basically you are required to write a short motivation about why you wish
		to join Tysan, and amend it should questions arise. The Senate will decide if you will be given a trial membership.
		
		<h2>How does this Trial Membership work?</h2> 
		A Trial membership is basically meant to get to know you better. We will use your trial time to see if we would like
		you to stay a member. During the Trial you will be assisted by a Mentor to guide you and introduce you to people. After
		two weeks, we will vote whether or not we want you to stay a member, and if 60% of the Clan votes in favor, you will
		become a Junior Member.
