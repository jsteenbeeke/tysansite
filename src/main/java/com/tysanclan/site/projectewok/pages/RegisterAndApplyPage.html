		<h2>Why should I join?</h2>
		The Tysan Clan has been around for over a decade and has proven itself to be a resilient clan well
		able to withstand the test of time. Throughout our lifetime we have managed to maintain a high standard
		of legit gameplay, mature members, and fun people to hang out with.
		
		<h2>What kind of people are you looking for?</h2>
		We are looking for people who like playing online games in a friendly environment. While we do play competitive games from time
		to time, and we do encourage getting better at them, it is not our goal to become pro players. Many of our members are parents,
		and we understand that family comes first, even if Tysan is a family of sorts as well. As such, we only accept those who have
		demonstrated themselves to be mature persons with a friendly attitude and a slight amount of insanity.
		
		<h2>So how do I join?</h2>
		Please fill out the form below, where you can create an account and add your motivations. <br /><br />
		
		Basically you are required to write a short motivation about why you wish to join Tysan, and amend it
		should questions arise (though this is generally not the case). After you submit, another member must volunteer to
		be your Mentor, and at least one Senator needs to approve your application.
		
		<h2>How does this Trial Membership work?</h2> 
		A Trial membership is basically meant to get to know you better. We will use your trial time to see if we would like
		you to stay a member. During the Trial you will be assisted by a Mentor to guide you and introduce you to people. After
		two weeks, we will vote whether or not we want you to stay a member, and if 60% of the Clan votes in favor, you will
		become a Junior Member.
