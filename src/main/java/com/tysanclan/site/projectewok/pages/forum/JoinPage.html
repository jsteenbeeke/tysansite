			Joining the Tysan Clan is in itself a simple process, though quite
			different from that of many other clans. The process takes approximately
			3 days, during which you may also withdraw your application. If you cannot
			wait 3 days
			
			<h2>Application</h2>
			To start the join process, you must first submit an application. This application
			will be publicly visible, and consists of a short motivation of why
			you wish to join.
			
			<h2>Mentor</h2>
			Once your application has been sent, another member must agree to become
			your mentor. If no mentor volunteers within three days, your application
			will be rejected.
			
			<h2>Approval</h2>
			Once you have a mentor, the Senate must approve your application. A Senator
			can vote either in your favor or against you. If at least 66% of the voting
			Senators vote in your favor, you will be granted a trial membership. If no Senators
			vote (which is rare, but possible), you will also be granted a trial membership.
			
			<h2>Proceed</h2>
			If you understand the above procedure, you may <a wicket:id="continue">continue the join procedure</a>.
