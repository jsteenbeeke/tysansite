	<span wicket:id="container"> Joining the Tysan Clan is in itself
		a simple process, though quite different from that of many other
		clans. The process can take up to three days (though it generally goes
		much faster; in theory it can be completed in under a minute), during
		which you may also withdraw your application.

		<h2>Application</h2> To start the join process, you must first submit
		an application. This application will be publicly visible, and
		consists of a short motivation of why you wish to join.

		<h2>Mentor</h2> Once your application has been sent, another member
		must agree to become your mentor. If no mentor volunteers within three
		days, your application will be rejected.

		<h2>Approval</h2> Once you have a mentor, a Senator must approve your
		application. A Senator can vote either in your favor or against you.
		As soon as you have both a Mentor and a Senate vote in your favor, you
		will be granted a trial membership.

		<h2>Proceed</h2> If you understand the above procedure, you may <a
		wicket:id="continue">continue the join procedure</a>.
